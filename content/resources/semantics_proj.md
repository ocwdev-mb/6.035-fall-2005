description: 'The static semantics phase of the project requires considerably more
  effort than the previous phase.Extend your compiler to find, report, and recover
  from semantic errors in Decaf programs. Most semantic errors can be checked by testing
  the rules enumerated in the section "Semantic Rules". This part of the project includes
  the following tasks: a) Add semantic actions to your CUP parser specification to
  construct a high-level intermediate representation (IR) tree, and to perform any
  semantic checks you choose to do as part of the parsing process, b) Build symbol
  tables for the classes, c) Perform all remaining semantic checks by traversing the
  IR and accessing the symbol tables.'
